A 3D platformer prototype, created in Unity, inspired by Mario 64. The game has a key focus on movement, 
with the intention of exploring primary mechanics to create deeper and more intricate gameplay.

### Features:
- Tight and fun-feeling movement (both ground and aerial)
- Wall jump
- Slide/Dash
- Various different types of platforms
- Camera control
- Controller support 

Rather than using Unity's built-in physics engine, the game utilises a custom built physics solution, designed specifically for 
the 3D platforming genre, inspired heavily by Super Mario 64.
